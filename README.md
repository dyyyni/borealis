# PKCS#11 Software Token in Rust 🛠️

Welcome to my take on the PKCS#11 Software Token in Rust! We are at the very beginning of this project, and honestly, we’ll probably stay here for a while. This is a personal passion project of mine, and the timeline for working on it is about as clear to me as it is to you.

The idea for this project stems from the work conducted during my master's thesis in the [NISEC](https://research.tuni.fi/nisec/) research group at Tampere University.
(I'll link the thesis once it gets published.)

The idea to create such a software token for research purposes originates from my supervisor, Nicola Tuveri's vision to develop a way for researchers to test their own algorithms within cryptographic libraries. You can read more about our work here: 
[QUBIP Blog: NSS and Firefox Transition to PQC](https://qubip.eu/transition-of-nss-and-firefox-to-support-the-quantum-secure-internet-browsing/)

For transparency: While the idea for this project originates from my work with the NISEC research group, I’ve since gone rogue and am now working on it independently. Consider this a personal passion project fueled by interest, curiosity, and maybe a bit of stubborn determination.

This project is heavily inspired by the [kryoptic](https://github.com/latchset/kryoptic) project, the original PKCS#11 software token written in Rust. My goal is to rewrite the project from scratch for learning purposes and to modify some design choices that I feel will better suit the vision I have.I will continue to use the GNU General Public License v3.0, as kryoptic did.

I hope to help some poor soul grasp the intricacies of PKCS#11. If you’re that soul, I wish you strength and a good supply of coffee.
